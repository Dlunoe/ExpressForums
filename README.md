# ExpressForums
## Description
This will be a basic forums app, providing a platform for general discussion and (in the future) other unrelated topics for user discussion. The idea is to create a usable forum for my pet project down the road. Every major game (but multiplayer games especially) has a common forum to discuss the game and bug fixes, as well as other topics.

## Languages
This app will use React for the client side of things, while using Mongo as the database and Express to handle the connections between the two. It has basic database structure that will allow it to easily add users as well as other topic categories.

## Future Versions
-Will add users to the database
--This will allow us to add specific permissions for each user, post, and comment.
-Will expand the structure to let different categories hold specific topics for discussion.
-With high hopes of creating a long-standing project, will attach to the Parent site rather than a stand alone site.
